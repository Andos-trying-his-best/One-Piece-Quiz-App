A simple, interactive anime quiz built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.
This project focuses on clean UI design and understanding **state-based logic** in JavaScript — no frameworks, no libraries.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was built as part of my JavaScript learning journey.
The main goal was to:

- Understand event listeners
- Control app state across multiple button clicks
- Improve UI layout and spacing

## 🚧 Known Limitations
